Overview of the Task: API Integration and Data Visualization
This task involves two main components:

1. API Integration
Objective: Fetch weather data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap).
Steps:
Choose the API: OpenWeatherMap's One Call API 3.0 is used to get weather data (hourly forecasts, daily trends, etc.).
API Key: Obtain an API key by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap website.
Make HTTP Requests: Use Python's requests library to send a GET request to the API endpoint with appropriate parameters (e.g., latitude, longitude, API key, units).
Parse JSON Response: Extract relevant information (e.g., temperature, humidity, weather description) from the JSON response provided by the API.

2. Data Visualization
Objective: Create visual representations of the fetched weather data to analyze trends and patterns.
Steps:

Data Processing:
Convert the API response into a structured format (e.g., a Pandas DataFrame).
Extract and format relevant data (e.g., timestamps, temperature, humidity).

Visualizations:
Line Plot: Show temperature trends over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Bar Plot: Display humidity levels for the same period.

Customization:
Add labels, titles, and legends to make the plots informative.
Format x-axis for better readability (e.g., rotating timestamps).
Deliverables

Python Script:
A complete script to fetch weather data and generate visualizations.
Includes functions for data fetching, processing, and plotting.
Visualization Dashboard:
Line plot for temperature trends.
Bar plot for humidity levels.
Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries:
requests: To interact with the API.
pandas: To process and structure data.
matplotlib & seaborn: To create visualizations.

Expected Outcome
A Python-based application that:
Fetches weather data for a given location.
Processes and visualizes the data in an easy-to-understand format.
A dashboard displaying temperature and humidity trends for a specific city or region.
